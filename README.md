# Maxel.store WordPress Template

In the process of creating the Maxel.store portfolio website, I developed a design using Figma and subsequently uploaded the file to the specified address. To translate this design into a functional website, I opted to utilize Elementor within WordPress, resulting in the creation of the Maxel.store template.

Maxel.store serves as my personal portfolio site, additionally functioning as a platform for offering various services. These services are categorized into three distinct packages: Basic, Standard, and Premium. 

I am pleased to offer this template for public use, provided that credit is acknowledged by mentioning my contribution in your project.

Here is the Figma design:
